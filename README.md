</div>

<ul style="background:#fffbe6; border-left:4px solid #ffe066; padding:8px 16px;">
  <li><i>Windows 11 or 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later.</i></li>
</ul>

1. Download `appup-update-engine.exe` from the `bin/` folder in this repository or from GitHub Releases.

     > üõ°Ô∏è **Virus Scanned**: This executable was scanned with VirusTotal  
     > [[Click Here To See Reports]](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0dc9936776f9f39a2a2c882385de0736df1cd83eba3ceec68510cadd5126a371)  
     > ‚úÖ 68 out of 72 antivirus engines marked it **clean**. A few AI-based engines raised false positives, which is common for Python-based `.exe` files built with PyInstaller.

2. Right-click `AppUp.exe` and select **Run as administrator** for a seamless update experience.  
     *Note: Running without administrator privileges may trigger Windows permission pop-ups during updates.*

3. Run `AppUP.exe`.

4. AppUP automatically performs a first-time setup to configure the Windows Package Manager (winget) on your system.

5. Wait a few seconds for AppUP to scan and display a table of available updates, showing each app‚Äôs current version and the latest available version.

6. Select apps to update:  
     - Enter numbers (e.g., `1,3`) to update specific apps.  
     - Enter `a` to update all apps.  
     - Enter `q` to abort and exit.

7. Sit back while AppUP downloads and installs the selected packages.  
     *Note: Download times may vary depending on your internet speed and the size of each update.*

## üß∞ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.
- **rich**: Library for dynamic terminal UI with tables and animations.
- **Standard Libraries**: `subprocess`, `sys`, `time`, `random`, `threading`.
- **PyInstaller**: Generates the standalone executable.
- **Windows Package Manager**: For scanning the avilable updates.


## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to some common problems you may encounter:
- **AppUP opens to a blank terminal window:**
  - Heavy background processes may slow down startup‚Äîtry closing unnecessary programs.
  - Ensure both Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable [(x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and [(x86)](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) are installed, as these are required for many apps to run properly.

- **winget not found or not working:**
  - Ensure you are running Windows 10/11 with the Windows Package Manager installed. You can get it from the Microsoft Store if missing.

- **Python script fails with missing module error:**
  - Run `pip install rich` in your terminal to install the required dependency.

- **Updates fail or apps do not install:**
  - Check your internet connection.
  - Make sure you have administrator privileges.
  - Some apps may require you to close them before updating.
